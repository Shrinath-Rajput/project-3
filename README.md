Garbage Classification System Using Opencv and Image Processing


📌 Project Overview

This project is a Garbage Classification System developed using Python, OpenCV, and MySQL. It is designed to automatically identify and categorize different types of waste — such as plastic, metal, rubber, wet, and dry waste — through image processing and database integration.

The goal is to promote smarter waste management and environmental sustainability by automating the garbage sorting process.

🎯 Features

📸 Image Processing: Captures and processes images of garbage items using OpenCV.

🧠 Garbage Classification: Classifies the waste type using pre-defined criteria and/or machine learning.

🗃️ Database Integration: Stores the classified image and result in a MySQL database.

⚡ Real-Time Detection: Displays the type of garbage on the screen when a new image is provided.


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV – for image analysis and processing

MySQL – for storing image data and classification results

Custom Backend Logic – for handling image input/output, processing, and data storage

🚀 How It Works

1. The user uploads or provides a new image of a garbage item.
2. The image is processed using OpenCV.
3. The system classifies the type of waste (e.g., Plastic, Metal, Rubber, Wet, Dry).
4. The classification result and the image are stored in a MySQL database.
5. The type of garbage is displayed to the user in real-time.

📈 Future Improvements

Integration of a machine learning model for more accurate classification.

Mobile app interface for easier user interaction.

Support for multi-class detection in a single image.

Cloud-based database storage for scalability.

💡 Motivation

This project was built to support sustainable development and efficient waste management by providing a tech-driven solution to garbage classification. Automating this task can help in recycling efforts and in reducing human effort.
